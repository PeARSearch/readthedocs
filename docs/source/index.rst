Welcome to the PeARS documentation!
===================================

**NB: this documentation is work in progress. Check back in later!**

**PeARS** (the People's Agent for Reciprocated Search) is a free search engine that you can run locally from your browser, or from your own server. It allows you to 'index' pages (i.e. to produce a computer-readable representation of the pages' content, essential to the search process), and to search pages that you or your friends have indexed. In a local setting, search happens entirely on your machine, meaning that no one knows what you are searching and when. In a decentralised setting, you and your friends can get together to maintain an search engine that you have entire control over.

If you are excited about the idea of a decentralised search engine, there are different ways you can contribute! Find out what you can do as:

* a :ref:`searcher <searcher>`
* a :ref:`curator <curator>`
* an instance :ref:`admin <admin>`

If you want to run your own PeARS, either locally or as a public instance, check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information on setting up the software.
